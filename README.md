# Dustify

This is my attempt at a AOBD(Another one Bites the Dust) based successor for 1.9.4, 1.10. 1.11, 1.12.

I'll edit this Readme later for better structure/content/reading

I've never coded seriously for minecraft before, this is my first attempt;

### The reason i'm creating this mod it's because i've a need to be able to PROCESS ALL THE ORES

### I'll be adding support for these mods:
You can contact me with a issue to ask for support on another mod;  
Please check if the mod already isn't processing correctly.  
(mods with - in version means the mod isn't on that version)  
(1.9.4)(1.10.2)(1.11)(1.12)  
1.12 will come when forge is out for it; i'm still not confortable enough to mod my own.  
This list is incomplete/as-is; I still have to comb it down if they really need to be here.
