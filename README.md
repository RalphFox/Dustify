This is my attempt at a AOBD(Another one Bites the Dust) spiritual successor for 1.10+.

I'll edit this Readme later for better structure/content/reading

I've never coded seriously for minecraft before, this is my first attempt;

The reason i'm creating this mod it's because i've a need to be able to PROCESS ALL THE ORES

I'll be adding support for these mods:

IndustrialCraft 2 (1.9.4+)
Railcraft (1.10+)
EnderIO (1.9.4+)
Applied Energistics (1.10+)
Thermal Expansion (1.10+)
Mekanism (1.9.4+)
Magneticraft (1.9.4+)
Modular Systems (1.9.4+)
Tinker's Construct (1.9.4+)
SimpleOreGrinder (1.9.4+)
Ex Nihilo Adscencio (1.10)
Ex Nihilo Omnia (1.10)

Those will not be supported, because they're below 1.9:
Ex Nihilo (pre 1.9, will not support)
Buildcraft additions (pre 1.9, will not support)
Engineers Toolbox (pre 1.9, will not support)
Steamcraft (pre 1.9, will not support)
Mariculture (pre 1.9, will not support)
Flaxbeard's Steampower Mod (pre 1.9, will not support)
Nether Ores (pre 1.9, will not support)
Thaumcraft (pre 1.9, will not support)
Factorization (pre 1.9, will not support)
Random Additions (pre 1.9, will not support)
Gany's Nether (pre 1.9, will not support)
Hydraulicraft (pre 1.9, will not support)
RotaryCraft (pre 1.9, will not support)
Electrical Age (pre 1.9, will not support)

I'm still thinking if i'm going to support 1.9.4 or not;

Expect this repository to have a lot of commits due to experimentation;
